# 08. Section 19 The Composition API - Replacing the Options API - Composition API Core Building Blocks

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on replacing the Options API with the Composition API, utilizing Vue.js core building blocks.

## Objectives

- Refactor a Vue.js component to use the Composition API instead of the Options API.
- Manage state, computed properties, methods, and watchers using the Composition API.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open the relevant Vue.js files in your code editor to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js` or `App.vue`: Contains the Vue.js application code refactored with the Composition API.
   - `components/` (if applicable): Contains component files.
   - `styles.css`: Styles for the project (if applicable).

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **State Management**: Use the `ref` function from the Composition API to manage state variables.
   - **Computed Properties**: Replace computed properties with the `computed` function from the Composition API.
   - **Methods**: Define methods using the `setup` function in the Composition API.
   - **Watchers**: Use the `watch` function to respond to changes in reactive data.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN if applicable.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the project in your web browser or code editor to view and interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Refactor the provided code to use the Composition APIâ€™s `ref`, `computed`, `watch`, and `setup` functions.
- Ensure that the functionality of the component remains consistent with the original Options API implementation.
