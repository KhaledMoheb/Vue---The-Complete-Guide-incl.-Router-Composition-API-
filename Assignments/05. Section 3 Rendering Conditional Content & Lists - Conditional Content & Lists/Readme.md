# 05. Section 3 Rendering Conditional Content & Lists - Conditional Content & Lists

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on rendering conditional content and managing lists in Vue.js.

## Objectives

- Manage a list of tasks within a Vue.js application.
- Add new tasks to the list based on user input.
- Toggle the visibility of the task list and update the button caption accordingly.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.
   - `styles.css`: Styles for the project (if applicable).

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **Task Management**: Add new tasks to a list when the "Add Task" button is clicked.
   - **List Rendering**: Display the list of tasks in an unordered list.
   - **Conditional Visibility**: Show or hide the task list when the "Hide / Show List" button is pressed. Update the button caption based on the list visibility.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes
