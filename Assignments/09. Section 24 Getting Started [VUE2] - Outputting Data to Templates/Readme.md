# 09. Section 24 Getting Started [VUE2] - Outputting Data to Templates

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on outputting data to templates using Vue.js.

## Objectives

- Use interpolation to display data within HTML templates.
- Call functions within templates to perform calculations and generate dynamic content.
- Bind attributes to dynamically update element properties.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **Name and Age Display**: Use interpolation to fill a paragraph with your name and age.
   - **Age Calculation**: Output your age multiplied by 3 using a function call.
   - **Random Number Generation**: Call a function to output a random float between 0 and 1.
   - **Image Display**: Bind the `src` attribute of an image element to display an image from a URL.
   - **Pre-Populated Input**: Set the `value` attribute of an input field to pre-populate it with your name.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Use Vue.js interpolation to dynamically insert data into your HTML.
- Bind element attributes to Vue.js data properties to dynamically update content.
