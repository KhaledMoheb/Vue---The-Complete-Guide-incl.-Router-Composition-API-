# 14. Section 27 An Introduction to Components VUE2 - Components

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on transforming an existing Vue.js project into one that utilizes components to enhance structure and maintainability.

## Objectives

- Transform a non-component-based Vue.js code into a component-based architecture.
- Create and use Vue components for various parts of the application.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Change into the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd [project-directory]
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the project dependencies using Yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn install
     ```

4. **Start the Development Server**
   - Serve the application using Yarn:
     ```bash
     yarn serve
     ```

5. **File Structure**
   - `src/components/`: Create and manage Vue components here.
   - `src/App.vue`: The main Vue component file where components are used.
   - `src/main.js`: The entry point for the Vue application.

6. **Features to Implement**
   - **Header Component**: Create a header component to display the title "Server Status."
   - **Server List Component**: Create a component to display a list of servers.
   - **Server Details Component**: Create a component to display server details.
   - **Footer Component**: Create a footer component with a message about server management.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection for Yarn to install packages and Vue.js to run.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - After installing dependencies and starting the server, open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address (usually `http://localhost:8080`) to view the transformed Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Use Vue.js component syntax to modularize your code.
- Ensure each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI and communicates with other components as needed.
- Review the video and source code provided in the course for detailed instructions on transforming the existing code.
