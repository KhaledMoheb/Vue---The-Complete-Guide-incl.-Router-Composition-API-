# 14. Section 27 An Introduction to Components [VUE2] - Components

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on practicing Vue.js components by transforming existing code into a component-based structure.

## Objectives

- Transform a codebase that doesnâ€™t use Vue components into one that uses as many meaningful components as possible.
- Practice organizing and structuring Vue.js applications using components.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the main HTML structure.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.
   - `styles.css`: Styles for the project (if applicable).

4. **Features to Implement**
   - **Header Component**: Create a header component to display the title "Server Status."
   - **Server List Component**: Create a component to display a list of servers. Use `v-for` to iterate through the list.
   - **Server Details Component**: Create a component to show server details.
   - **Footer Component**: Create a footer component to display the text "All Servers are managed here."

5. **Assignment Details**
   - **Component Breakdown**: Decompose the provided HTML into reusable Vue.js components.
   - **Integration**: Ensure that the components are integrated correctly into the main application.
   - **Styling**: Apply appropriate styling to each component (optional).

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Review the provided video for detailed instructions on how to decompose the code into components.
- Ensure that components are reusable and logically organized.
- Apply styling to enhance the appearance of each component.
