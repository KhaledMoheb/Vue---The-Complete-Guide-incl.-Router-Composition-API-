# 11. Section 25 Using VueJS to Interact with the DOM [VUE2] - Reactive Properties

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on using Vue.js to create reactive properties and interact with the DOM.

## Objectives

- Show a "result" of 'not there yet' as long as "value" is not equal to 37.
- Change the "value" with buttons.
- Print 'done' once the "value" reaches 37.
- Watch for changes in the "result" and reset the "value" after 5 seconds.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **Reactive Value Display**: Show the current "value" and update it using buttons.
   - **Result Calculation**: Display a "result" of 'not there yet' until the "value" is 37, then print 'done'.
   - **Reset Value**: Watch for changes in the "result" and reset the "value" to 0 after 5 seconds using `setTimeout`.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Use Vue.js reactive properties to dynamically update the DOM based on data changes.
- Implement methods to handle button clicks and update the data properties.
- Use watchers to monitor changes in data properties and perform actions based on those changes.
