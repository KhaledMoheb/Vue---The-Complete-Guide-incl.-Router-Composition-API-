# 13. Section 26 Using Conditionals and Rendering Lists [VUE2] - Conditionals & Lists

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on using Vue.js to handle conditionals and render lists dynamically.

## Objectives

- Toggle the display of two paragraphs using both `v-if` and `v-show`.
- Render a list from an array and display each element with its index.
- Display all key-value pairs of a given object, including the index of each item.
- Render values from an object with a nested array, including a nested loop for the array elements.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **Toggle Display**: Use `v-if` and `v-show` to toggle the visibility of two paragraphs.
   - **Array Rendering**: Render an unordered list (`<ul>`) from an array and display each element with its index.
   - **Object Key-Value Pairs**: Print all key-value pairs of a given object and include the index of each item.
   - **Nested Object Rendering**: Print values from an object, including handling a nested array using a nested loop with `v-for` and `v-if`.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Use Vue.js directives like `v-if` and `v-show` for conditional rendering.
- Utilize `v-for` for rendering lists and arrays dynamically.
- Implement nested loops and conditionals to handle complex data structures.
