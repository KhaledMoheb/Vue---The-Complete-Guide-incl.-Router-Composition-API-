# 04. Section 2 Basics & Core Concepts - Dynamic Styling

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on dynamic styling in Vue.js, including CSS class binding and inline styles.

## Objectives

- Apply user-entered CSS classes to a paragraph.
- Toggle visibility of a paragraph using CSS classes.
- Add dynamic inline styling to a paragraph based on user input.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.
   - `styles.css`: Styles for the project (if applicable).

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **CSS Class Binding**: Fetch user input and apply it as a CSS class to a paragraph. Available classes are "user1" and "user2".
   - **Paragraph Visibility Toggle**: Use "visible" and "hidden" classes to show or hide a paragraph when a button is clicked.
   - **Dynamic Inline Styling**: Allow the user to enter a background color that will be applied as inline styling to a paragraph.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to interact with the Vue.js application.
