# 10. Section 25 Using VueJS to Interact with the DOM [VUE2] - Events

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on using Vue.js to interact with the DOM through event handling.

## Objectives

- Show an alert when a button is clicked.
- Listen to the "keydown" event and store the input value in a data property.
- Adjust the keydown event to only store the value if the "Enter" key is pressed.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **Show Alert**: Display an alert when the button is clicked.
   - **Keydown Event Handling**: Listen to the "keydown" event on an input field and store the value in a data property.
   - **Enter Key Handling**: Adjust the keydown event handling to only store the value if the "Enter" key is pressed.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view and interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Use Vue.js event handling to respond to user interactions.
- Store and update data properties based on DOM events.
- Implement conditional logic to handle specific key events.
