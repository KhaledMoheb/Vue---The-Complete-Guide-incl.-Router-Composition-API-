# 03. Section 2 Basics & Core Concepts - Reactivity

## Overview

This assignment is part of the Udemy course "Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)." It focuses on Vue.js reactivity, handling dynamic data, and watching for changes.

## Objectives

- Connect buttons to modify a numerical value and display specific messages based on the value.
- Watch for changes in the value and reset it to 0 after 5 seconds.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```

2. **Open the Project**
   - Navigate to the project directory and open `index.html` in your web browser to see the Vue.js application in action.

3. **File Structure**
   - `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and Vue.js directives.
   - `app.js`: Contains the Vue.js application code.
   - `styles.css`: Styles for the project (if applicable).

4. **Features Implemented**
   - **Value Calculation**: The buttons add to a number and display "Not there yet" until the number equals 37. If the number exceeds 37, it displays "Too much!".
   - **Value Watching**: Resets the value to 0 after 5 seconds of reaching exactly 37.

## Usage

1. **Internet Connection**
   - Ensure you have an internet connection as Vue.js is loaded via a CDN.

2. **Viewing the Assignment**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to interact with the Vue.js application.

## Notes

- Implement reactivity in Vue.js to dynamically update the DOM based on user interactions.
- Utilize Vue's `watch` functionality to respond to changes in data.
